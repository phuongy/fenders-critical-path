# Critical Path
- Talk about the order in which things load for a website
     - html file
     - resources from top to bottom
     - blocking css, fonts, images and scripts
     - optimisation recommendations from google insights
- Reason why we need critical path optimisations
     - flash of un-styled content
     - load a background colour to avoid white blank page
     - show layout and basic styles for things above the fold
